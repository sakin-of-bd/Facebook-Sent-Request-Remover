# Facebook-Sent-Request-Remover

Hello guys!!!.....
I am back with another amaizing tool.ðŸ¥°
Here I am providing you a simple 5-6 lines of JavaScript code by which you can easily cancel all of your sent friend request.
Now, I am telling you the full process about it.

1. Firstly, you have to download the <Facebook_Sent_Request_Remover.txt> file from the  <Facebook-Sent-Request-Remover> Repository.
2. Open the .txt folder and minimize it.
3. Then copy this link and paste it into Google Chrome and go> "https://m.facebook.com/friends/center/requests/outgoing"
4. Make sure that you are logged in into the browser and this process is 100% Secure.
5. Then, you can see your sent friend request lists.
6. After that, right click on your mouse into the webpage and click on inspect.
7. Click on the Console section and start writing the .txt files full code and enter that. Since, pasting a copied code is not allowed, so you have to write the code manually. ðŸ˜­
8. See, your sent friend requests are automatically removing. Remember, this code can just remove the loaded sent requests on the browser only. So, refresh the page and do this process again untill you have removed all of your sent friend requests.
9. Here you can face a problem which is writing the .txt files code again and again which is disgusting. I have solutions for this also. Just simply put your cursor on the console sections page and enter the UP button on your Keyboard.

Now, Enjoy your life ðŸ˜Ž.
